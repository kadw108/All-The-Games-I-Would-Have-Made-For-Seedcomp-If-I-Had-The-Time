This game is called Unfinished Mushroom Story 3, since I have two other, different stories about mushrooms that are also unfinished. They may or may not all have the same setting: a post-apocalyptic world ridden by (you guessed it) mushrooms.

I like mushrooms.

The crux of the setting is that the apocalypse isn't really an apocalypse. In fact, the spread of fungal life has made life eminently more tolerable for every living creature on Earth, with the exception of a few humans who are abnormally attached to the old way of going about things, to a psychologically damaging degree.

In this one, you're the companion or servant of a mycelial entity called the Daughter of Annelids. With it by your side, you investigate the spread of an unusual species of mold in an old woman's house.

The old woman is one of those people who remains attached to her old life. Where normal members of the mycelial network dream of mingling their spores over rotting corpses and so on, she dreams about investment banking. Her dreams infect the surrounding fungi of her home, and now anyone who approaches the house begins to hallucinate leverage ratios, W-12 forms, and tax-exempt money market funds. Most fungoids find this deeply disturbing.

You, as a human, remember the past world and therefore have a higher tolerance for this kind of thing. Together with your eldritch fungal companion, you do... something. Haven't quite worked out the endings yet.
