        <p>This game is set in a post-apocalyptic world ridden by (you guessed it) mushrooms. The crux of the setting is that the apocalypse isn't really an apocalypse. In fact, the spread of fungal life has made life better for every living creature on Earth, with the exception of a few humans who are abnormally attached to the old way of going about things.</p>

        <p>In this one, you're the companion or servant of a mycelial entity called the daughter of annelids. With it by your side, you investigate the spread of an unusual species of mold in an old woman's house.</p>

        <p>The woman is one of those people who remains attached to her old life. Where normal members of the mycelial network dream of mingling their spores over rotting corpses and so on, she dreams about investment banking. Her dreams infect the surrounding fungi of her home, and now anyone who approaches the house begins to hallucinate leverage ratios, W-12 forms, and tax-exempt money market funds. Most fungoids find this deeply disturbing.</p>

        <p>You, as a human, remember the past world and therefore have a higher tolerance for this kind of thing. Together with your eldritch fungal companion, you have to resolve the woman's issues.</p>

        <p>The game is okay, I guess. But too short to give us a good idea of the setting. I wish there was more.</p>

        <p>liked the poem the author used at the start</p>

        <p>Rock-a-bye baby, in these twilight glooms,<br>
        Borne of autumn, when the star-wind pours<br>
        Down hilltop streets, quiet out-of-doors,<br>
        But shewing lamplight from nursery rooms.<br>
        The dead leaves rush in strange, merry twists,<br>
        And chimney-smoke whirls round with alien grace,<br>
        Heeding geometries of outer space,<br>
        While Fomalhaut peers in through southward mists.<br>
        <br>
        This is the hour when moonstruck children know<br>
        What fungi sprout in Yuggoth, and what scents<br>
        And tints of flowers fill Nithonâ€™s continents,<br>
        Such as in no poor earthly garden blow.<br>
        Listen now for the dreams these winds convey.<br>
        Sleep, and let them take you far away.</p>

        <p>The daughter of annelids blinks its thousands of eyes at you. It drifts to your side, throbbing, pulsating, buoyed by gas sacs and clouds of sporedust that hold its spherical body aloft. <em>We are interested in seeing how you will handle this problem,</em> it says.</p>

        <p>"You won't lead here?" you ask.</p>
