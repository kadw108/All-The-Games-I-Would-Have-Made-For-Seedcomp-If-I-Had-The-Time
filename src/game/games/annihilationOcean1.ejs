    <p class="para1"><span class="span0">                </span><span class="span0">Our world was called Europa. It was located on Jupiter&apos;s moon of the same name, a distant satellite far from our ruined Earth. Still, it was based on the city around us. We gave Europa our broken skyscrapers and bombed-out buildings, our scrapyards and junkheaps, reimagined into something greater. The skyscrapers grew into elegant spires, nestled in underwater spheres. Around them sprouted clockwork gardens and nectar fountains. Hospitals that could grow you new limbs, or a new body. Machines that resurrected the dead. It was utopian.</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span0">                </span><span class="span0">I remember Europa only in fragments. But I can still picture the towers, encased in their glass bubbles. Undersea sanctuaries held in perfect crystalline stasis. They feel almost real.</span></p>

    <p class="para1"><span class="span0">                </span><span class="span0">All cities are built on graves. Where we lived was an endless procession of them: buried bunkers and boiling refuse pits, mausoleums and catacombs, grasping for the sky. The city rebuilt itself, continuously. Buildings inside buildings, buildings atop buildings, a conglomeration of ruins from eras past and present, gathering until the fruits of one century were indistinguishable from the next. Time became meaningless.</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span0">                </span><span class="span0">Only unlucky families lived close to the exterior, where acid rain sizzled over the old battlefields. When it rained, we hid. Those too slow to find shelter were found after the weather cleared, cradling their former limbs. For fear of exposure, some people never went outside at all.</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span0">                </span><span class="span0">But during the dry season, when the wind blew clear, my brother and I joined the other children in venturing aboveground. We climbed the mossgrown radio masts to watch the exploratory ships depart, their gray smokestacks unfurling over the ocean.</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span0">                </span><span class="span0">That ship would beat all the others in a fight, I&apos;d tell him. He&apos;d say, nah, check out the killer turrets on this one. He&apos;d pucker up his lips and make turret sounds and I&apos;d laugh.</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span0">                </span><span class="span0">Bet you this one lasts the longest. Bet you that one sinks first. We didn&apos;t think about the volunteers on those ships, risking everything to search for other surviving communities. Of course, we knew what happened to them. When a certain distance was reached, signal quality began to degrade. The connection was lost. After that, they never came back.</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span0">                </span><span class="span0">&quot;Where do you think they end up?&quot; I asked, once. I expected him to spin up some tale about some island sanctuary on the other side of the planet, where fruit grew in abundance and you never had to hide from the rain.</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span0">                </span><span class="span0">But he only said, &quot;Somewhere better than here.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span0">                </span><span class="span0">When we tired of pitting our favorite ships against each other, we competed on climbing the radio masts. Looking into the water, we could pretend the war had never happened, and we lived in a more beautiful world, with Europa&apos;s cities beneath the waves. Its spheres glittered through the polluted haze. Its gates awaited us.</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span0">                </span><span class="span0">Later, I would stare at the same ocean and imagine he was out there somewhere, still alive.</span></p>

    <p class="para1"><span class="span0">                </span><span class="span0">What are my memories of childhood? I can’t be certain. I know our home, like most others, was repurposed from a wartime bunker. Rust tinted the walls. Blue lights blinked on the ceiling and I watched them at night, pretending they were stars. We had no windows. The encasement of old skyscrapers that protected us from the rain also stopped us from seeing outside.</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span0">                </span><span class="span0">My brother&apos;s side of the room was always piled with books: magazines and comics when he was young, then textbooks on physics and structural engineering. As a child I pored over them and </span><span class="span0">imagined mutant buildings swelling outside the confines of the bunker. Support beams rusted over the thousand war relics glimmering on the beach, ready to attack unlucky scavengers. Burrow into their brains and fill them with fire.</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span0">                </span><span class="span0">But even those recollections feel incomplete. Sometimes I wonder if any of it is true at all. After his disappearance I recited stories to myself, to sear some impression of him into my memory. I wanted to preserve him. I wanted to slow the decay that would occur over the years, as I slowly lost the particulars of his life: his personality, his appearance, his mannerisms, until I forgot who he was entirely.</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span0">                </span><span class="span0">When Mom and Dad were too tired to take care of me, which was often, he did it in their stead. He told me tales, and was the only one who listened to mine. He drew leviathans and robots I pinned to my walls. I populated Europa with my delusions, but he brought them to life. He made it into a true paradise, of the kind lost to humanity, and it captivated me.</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span0">                </span><span class="span0">Often he built Europa&apos;s cities from clay or sketched their maps on paper. He let me try to navigate them with a toy figurine, making up tricks and traps that awaited me at each turn. But I always made it through.</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span0">                </span><span class="span0">In my optimism, I believed this would never end. Even as he grew older, stressed, more detached. Entering university he became serious, even somber, and the games we played were forgotten.</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span0">                </span><span class="span0">I don&apos;t know which would be worse—that I could have saved him and didn&apos;t, or that I couldn&apos;t have helped him at all. But I think it was the second. Whatever changed in him, I couldn&apos;t undo it. Even when he did agree to spend time with me, which was less and less often, I knew he didn&apos;t want to be there.</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span0">                </span><span class="span0">&quot;I don&apos;t have time,&quot; he started telling me.</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span0">                </span><span class="span0">And I&apos;d say, &quot;You used to be a fun person to hang around and now you&apos;re just like everyone else. What&apos;s wrong with you? When did you stop caring?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span0">                </span><span class="span0">&quot;There&apos;s no point to that stuff. Stop being such a kid.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span0">                </span><span class="span0">&quot;You were supposed to be with me. You were supposed to believe in something out there.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span0">                </span><span class="span0">&quot;I don&apos;t play stupid games anymore,&quot; he told me. &quot;Go away. Grow up.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span0">                </span><span class="span0">If I had known he would disappear, would I have treated him differently? Or would I have treated him the way I did then, with mingled envy and annoyance, wondering when he&apos;d left me behind? Too often I felt like his faint shadow, a distorted reflection of everything about him that made him worthy of love. As he devoted himself to his studies, I became his mediocre double. I learned to watch from the wayside as teachers sang his praises, while I struggled through the classes he had excelled in five years prior. He was a brilliant student, a valued contributor to the community, whose existence made the world a better place. I only scraped by in comparison.</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span0">                </span><span class="span0">But I knew what he hid from everyone else. At night while the rain pounded above us I would see him bent over the desk, face half-hidden in the dark, while bottles and pills lay scattered on the table.</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span0">                </span><span class="span0">One insomniac night, while he slept, I crept to the closet where he kept his stash. The alcohol burned down my throat, tasting the way I imagined blood would taste, or the toxic sea.</span></p>

    <p class="para1"><span class="span0">                </span><span class="span0">I had finished my schooling by the time he disappeared, but couldn’t commit to any line of work. My periods of unemployment grew longer and longer. Eventually, my father got me a position working on the communication arrays. He was a middle manager in one of the many companies active in the city, researching various aspects of post-war life. Since my status was sheer nepotism, no one took me seriously. I didn&apos;t care.</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span0">                </span><span class="span0">My would-be coworkers were only &quot;scientists&quot; to me. I knew they had more specific roles, but there were too many of them, and I never spoke to any one long enough to become familiar. They were an amorphous group interchangeable in the way they looked past me. I was assigned menial tasks, and more often than not they forgot I existed. I existed in a state of apathy or something beyond apathy, like a rat in a cage content to let the world pass by, like a fish in a bowl circling within fetid water. They did </span><span class="span0">not treat me like a person, and I was fine with this because I had known all along that I was not a person, only a false impression of one.</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span0">                </span><span class="span0">I spent more and more time in the communications center, listening to crackling transmissions from across the globe, watching black-and-white broadcasts, tuning myself to the static. I learned to tune the bristling array of dishes and antennae to my liking, adjusting the knobs and dials. I could monitor the received signals, looking for the intersection of factors which indicated a location could possibly be receptive to one of our bio-engineered crop breeds.</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span0">                </span><span class="span0">The communications array was a flower of satellite dishes and wide-beam receivers. Its metal beams towered high above the ground, dripping with vines that intertwined with its bulk, leaves bristling, antennae twitching in the darkness. In the darkness the radio lights blinked on and off, and the low hum filled my bones.</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span0">                </span><span class="span0">In the darkness I would imagine myself a radio dish, a living receiver ready to pass the thousand data streams to the central source which loomed above me.

    <p class="para1"><span class="span0">                </span><span class="span0">People more brilliant than me had developed remote drones to expand the communications network. Yearly scientists gathered outside to send their newest iterations into the air. We monitored them as they flew past the array&apos;s dark silhouette, spiraling into the night.

Curiosity and boredom and despair, all commingled, until I needed something to break the mundanity of days that </span><span class="span0">blurred into each other and would forever.

    <p class="para1"><span class="span0">                </span><span class="span0">Then vertigo bubbling up within. I felt the space between my thoughts expanding. A false vacuum collapse of the brain. The rest of the world grew more and more distant, and distance collapsed to one point and the skein of the universe bent around me and shattered.</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span0">                </span><span class="span0">My body was rotating though I wasn&apos;t moving but shrinking to a pinpoint, and the enormity of the world spread itself out behind my eyes. I floated beneath the waves where my brother&apos;s corpse drifted. Maggots lived in his jowls and fish swam alongside his intestines squirming from the prison of his body and I could reach out my hands and touch him. When we were younger we played together near the sea. Now he floated dead, hair splayed out and skull smiling, sinking ever lower beneath the waves, body grown grotesque. His eyes spilled from their sockets, jelly pustules for eels to lay eggs in. His nails peeled in the watery darkness and his plummeting heart became whalefood and all around me the deep-sea carnivores waited.</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span0">                </span><span class="span0">He said, Come to me.</span></p>

    <p class="para1"><span class="span0">                </span><span class="span0">But not scared enough to go back. I lingered, feeling like a coward, doing nothing. The night grew colder and the wind blew through my bare skin. I realized I was only an observer of my own life, who unlike my peers did not have the acumen to become anybody of note and would die alone. I felt without seeing the surreal moon on the shores, the black ruins of floating islands and oil rigs and wrecked skyscrapers that had washed out and piled up high in the ocean. Those twisted pillars, remnants of old megastructures, their tips still sticking out above the sea. The rest all lost to rust and corrode.</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span0">                </span><span class="span0">I watched them, and I watched the reflection of the moon breaking on the waves, and I saw my brother&apos;s body. I see it now when I close my eyes.</span></p>
    <p class="para1"><span class="span0">                </span><span class="span0">Now the beach reoccurs in my dreams. That wrecked shore with the ruins shining above the lone and level water, shattered constructs clawing at the sky. In my dreams the crooked machinery is even more crooked. Rust seeps into the blood-red sea. The waters rise, and day by day with the haze in the air it becomes harder to breathe. Even the crops that the scientists try so hard to acclimate to the new shifts in temperature, the toxins in this ravaged landscape, do not survive. It may all come to nothing. The ocean will wash over our failures, and in the ruins of our pitiful attempts to rebuild life will sprout from the wreckage and it will be nothing we recognize.</span></p>
