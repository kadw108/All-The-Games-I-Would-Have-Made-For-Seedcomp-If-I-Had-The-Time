        <p>Use a poem as an inspiration for a game, but reverse its tone. For instance, find a sad poem and make a comedy of it. Or a silly poem and make it a horror story. Or a love poem and make a game about hate, or vice versa. Stick to the locations, ideas, or characters of the poem so that the game is recognizable as being inspired by it, but the emotion, the feel of the work needs to be opposite.</p>
